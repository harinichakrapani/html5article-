Latino immigrants have become the target of Donald Trump's fiercely xenophobic presidential campaign. 


"They're [Mexicans] taking our jobs. They're taking our manufacturing jobs. They're taking our money. They're killing us," said Trump at his July 11 campaign event in Phoenix, Arizona last year.   

<br> 
<br> 
While he proposes to build a $8bn to keep Mexicans away, the Washington D.C. -based think tank Center of Immigration Studies is providing more fuel to the anti-immigration tirade. 
According to its <a href="http://cis.org/61-Million-Immigrants-and-Their-Young-Children-Now-Live-in-the-United-States" target="_blank"> 2015 analysis of census data </a>, the number of immigrants entering the United States has nearly quintupled from 13.5 million in 1970 to 61 million in 2015.  
So, are Latino immigrants really flooding into the country? Here's what the data tell us. </p> 

<br> 
<br> 

<p> 
According to the Census Bureau 2014 data, Latin American born immigrants living the United States have declined over the past decade by 20 percent. </p>

"With the recession, border control efforts and the improving economic conditions in Mexico, there was a sharp drop in immigration in Mexico," explained Jeanne Batalova, a senior policy analyst and manager of the liberal Migration Policy Institute in Washington D.C. 


<br> 
<br> 
"2013 was a shifting point, when India and China overtook Mexico as the source of immigrants," added Batalova. 
As per the census, the Asian-born population surpassed Latinos and doubled from pre-millennium figures. 
Batalova acknowledged that even though Mexicans were the largest immigrant group with a population of <a href="http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/mexican-immigrants-united-states" target="_blank"> 11.7 million in 2014, their population hadn't grown since 2010</a>. </p>

The Bureau of Labor Statistics notes, black immigrants accounted for the leading demographic (71.7 percent) actively looking for jobs in the United States measured as the Labor force Participation Rate. 
<br> 
While Latinos ranked second at 68.9 percent and Asians third at 63.8 percent. 

<br> 
<br> 

The Pew Research center also released a report indicating that 3.8 million black immigrants live in United States, moving from Caribbean and African countries including Jamaica, Haiti, Nigeria, amongst others. 

Hispanics also accounted for the second highest unemployed demographic with an unemployment rate of 5.9 percent following blacks at 8.6 percent. 
<br> 
<br> 
Labor force participation and unemployment rates for both foreign born and native-born residents were similar. 

Ira Mehlman, director of media at the Federation of American Reform believed that the labor force participation rates among natives was the lowest in 40 years and immigrants were exploiting this shortage. 
"After the recession, unemployment rates came down. But the jobs, that replaced the ones that been lost, were not of the same quality. They didn't pay the same amount. The low labor force participation created unnecessary competition while a lot of workers in the country struggled," he said. </p>

The census data shows disparity in the types of occupation held by foreign born and native born demographic. 

More natives occupied managerial roles in business, finance than foreigners. Other fields where natives outnumbered foreigners were law, arts, and sales. 

Foreigners surpassed native born in healthcare, computer, architecture and engineering and food preparation. </p>

The disparity extended to earnings. 

Natives earned $820 weekly, while foreigners made $664. </p>

Interestingly, amongst the same racial groups, foreign-born residents had higher weekly earnings than their counterparts. 

Hispanics were the only exception, with immigrants earning $139 less than their native born counterparts.  </p>

 <p> Whether or not Mr. Trump wins the Republican nomination, his argument about Hispanics taking away American jobs remains flawed.  </p>
